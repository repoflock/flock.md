# Changelog

Spec versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org). While in `0.x`, minor versions may
change the spec incompatibly.

## 0.2.0 — draft (unreleased)

Theme: tool-friendly, never tool-required. Everything below is SHOULD/MAY; 0.1
adoptions remain conforming.

- Flow profile: document label block — `Status` / optional `Target` (version or
  milestone aimed at) / three-way-link labels; tools must ignore unknown labels (§3.1).
- Starter templates for feature / blueprint / worklog in `spec/templates/` (§3.2).
- Machine-writable index, opt-in: a table headed `| Item | Target | Status | Docs |`
  (Target omissible); a tool appends rows there and must not guess when the table is
  absent (§3.3).
- Named stage transitions **Open** (→ Design) and **Advance** (Design → Building) so
  tools can implement them; results stay uncommitted for human review, existing files
  are never overwritten (§3.4).
- Agents: prefer transitions + templates over invented structure (§5).

## 0.1.0 — draft (unreleased)

- Initial draft: `FLOCK.md` entry-point file, core profile (Docs Map, Index, Status
  Labels), flow profile (brd → feature → blueprint → worklog + index, three-way
  linking), history conventions (dated decisions, supersede-in-place, record the road
  not taken), agent guidance.
